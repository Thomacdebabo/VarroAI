# AI based detection of dead varroa

Beekeepers nowadays have to worry a lot about a species of parasitic mites called varroa. A beekeeper has to monitor the amount of varroa in each beehive and has to count how many dead ones there are.

This project aims to eliminate the need to manually count the amount of varroa for each beehive. Instead we want to use classical computer vision algorithms combined with machine learning.

## Training the model
I made a small GUI so we can track the training progress. It provides a small selection of filters and some examples.
